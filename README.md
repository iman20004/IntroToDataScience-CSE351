# IntroToDataScience-CSE351
Course at Stony Brook University 

## Assignments
- Assingment 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
- Assingment 2 - Prediction/Modelling

## Learning Objectives
- This multidisciplinary course introduces both theoretical concepts and practical approaches to extract knowledge from data. 
- Topics include linear algebra, probability, statistics, machine learning, and programming. 
- Using large data sets collected from real-world problems in areas of science, technology, and medicine, we introduce 
    - how to preprocess data, 
    - identify the best model that describes the data, 
    - make predictions, 
    - evaluate the results, 
    - and finally report the results using proper visualization methods. 
- This course also teaches state-of-the art tools for data analysis, such as Python and its scientific libraries.
